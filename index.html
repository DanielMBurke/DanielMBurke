              <span class="bio"> Welcome to the website of Daniel Burke, a proud father of three and  advocate of creativity and innovation through any technological means. 
             <br>  <br><span class="bio"> Before joining the realm of technology, I was a jack of all trades or "everyman" in the retail sector. Over an extensive timeline while working at Toys'R'Us, I was able to acquire significant leadership and communication experience working in every department at my disposal up to and including management.

                  <br> <br>
         <span class="bio">   After undertaking the challenging course load at Tech Elevator's coding bootcamp, I've aimed to aid an exuberant and enlightening team with a common goal of innovating through technology in order to improve everyday lives. I will continue to further my coding prowess in other forms as I engage in the daily challenges ahead.

            </span>   <br>  <br>  <span class="bio">When I'm not tinkering with technology, I enjoy spending my free time with my boys outside, walking the metroparks or catching up on the latest trending films.
