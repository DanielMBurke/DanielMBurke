              <span class="bio"> Welcome to the website of Daniel Burke, a proud father of three and extensive advocate of creativity and innovation through technological means. 
             <br> <span class="bio"> Before joining the realm of technology, I was a jack of all trades or "everyman" in the retail sector. Over the extensive timeline I spent working at Toys'R'Us, I was able to acquire experience by working full time in every department at my disposal including management.
  </span>                 <span class="bio">When I'm not tinkering with technology, I enjoy spending my free time with my boys outside, walking the metroparks or catching up on the latest trending films. 

 </span>
                  <br>
         <span class="bio">   After undertaking a challenging course load at Tech Elevator's coding bootcamp in Cleveland, Ohio, I aim to join an exuberant and enlightening team. I hope to further my coding prowess in other form as I engage in daily challenges ahead to be met with complex solutions.
