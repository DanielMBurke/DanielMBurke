##   **A Brief Background** 
 I have dabbled in a vast **[array]** of occupations over the years. 
 Just to list a few:
- Grocery Clerk
- State Worker (ODOT)
- ID checker 
- Aquatic Specialist
- Truck processor at UPS
- Professional Actor and Director
- Store management
    
## **Why I'm here** 
   
 Each career I've encountered has sculpted me into pursuing a much more 
 _"real"_ endeavor within the tech industry. While all the previous occupations 
 "paid the bills", I simply wasn't feeling fulfilled in my work. 
 I truly wish to pursue a career that will have reciprocal returns 
 given the strong efforts I put forth.

    
## **My inspiration**

  My drive to reach an accomplished role in technology is completely encompassed by my family. I have taken a huge leap from a "comfortable" background in retail to a new, and in some instances, alien domain. My family is a constant reminder of all the amazing things which life has presented me with. Having their unceasing support and constant source of happiness are an integral part of my success thus far.

As many have discovered, I have a simple hobby in photoshoping and gif creation. I hope to utilize this in a more professional standard aside from creating variants of the highly acclaimed [Party Parrot](http://cultofthepartyparrot.com/). 
Sorry [dancing banana](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/peanut-butter-jelly-time), Ebaum's World circa 2002 called, they want their meme back.

## My Plan Going forward

My "end-game" would ultimately be to acquire a developer role with a company that aligns their motivtions with my own. Namely, I endeavour to find that the goals of a company are aimed for the benefit of the community at large in addition to its employees. I aim to find a position that allows for a life outside of the workplace so I can enjoy spending quality time with my family.
